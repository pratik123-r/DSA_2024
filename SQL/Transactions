Handling concurrency in SQL is critical to ensure data integrity when multiple users or processes access or modify data at the same time.

üß† What is Concurrency?
Concurrency in SQL means multiple transactions accessing the same data at the same time.

‚ö†Ô∏è Risks:
Dirty reads: Read uncommitted data.

Lost updates: One update overwrites another.

Non-repeatable reads: Data changes during a transaction.

Phantom reads: New rows appear during a scan.

‚úÖ Techniques to Handle Concurrency in SQL
1. Transactions
Group operations into a transaction to ensure atomicity.

sql
Copy
Edit
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE account_id = 1;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 100
WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
2. Isolation Levels
SQL defines four isolation levels to control concurrency behavior:

Level	Dirty Read	Non-Repeatable Read	Phantom Read
READ UNCOMMITTED	‚úÖ	‚úÖ	‚úÖ
READ COMMITTED	‚ùå	‚úÖ	‚úÖ
REPEATABLE READ	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚úÖ
SERIALIZABLE	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚ùå

sql
Copy
Edit
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
üîí The stricter the level, the more locking is used ‚Äî and less concurrency, but better consistency.

3. Row-Level Locking
Databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL (InnoDB), and SQL Server support row-level locks.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE order_id = 1
FOR UPDATE;
This locks the selected row until the transaction ends.

4. Optimistic Locking (Manual in SQL)
Instead of locking rows, use a version number or timestamp to detect conflicting updates.

Example table:

sql
Copy
Edit
UPDATE products
SET stock = stock - 1, version = version + 1
WHERE product_id = 101 AND version = 5;
If version doesn‚Äôt match, another user already updated it ‚Üí handle conflict in app.

5. Pessimistic Locking
Assume conflict is likely ‚Üí lock rows to prevent others from reading/writing.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM inventory
WHERE item_id = 42
FOR UPDATE;
Other transactions trying to update the same row will wait or block.

6. Deadlock Handling
Deadlocks can occur when two transactions wait on each other.

Use short transactions.

Access tables in consistent order.

Handle deadlocks in app layer with retry logic.

‚úÖ Best Practices
Tip	Why It Helps
Use transactions	Ensure atomic operations
Use proper isolation levels	Balance between concurrency and consistency
Keep transactions short	Reduces lock time and deadlock chance
Index wisely	Avoid full-table locks
Use optimistic locking for scale	Reduces locking in high-concurrency systems

üí° Bonus: Tools and DB-Specific Features
PostgreSQL: MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control), advisory locks.

MySQL InnoDB: Row-level locking, gap locks.

SQL Server: Snapshot isolation, hints like WITH (ROWLOCK, XLOCK).
