/**
    Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the 
    zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative 
    integers to the front by maintaining their order.

    Example 1:
    Input:
    1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
    Output:
    1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
    Explanation:
    All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

    Example 2:
    Input:
    1,2,0,1,0,4,0
    Output:
    1,2,1,4,0,0,0
    Explanation:
    All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order
